# Description
In this project, we conducted a comprehensive study on emerging residential IP proxy as a service (RPaaS), between May 2017 and March 2018. Our study identified lots of interesting findings and answered several important questions around RPaaS. 
You can refer to [our paper](https://mixianghang.github.io/pubs/rpaas.pdf) (published on IEEE S&P 2019) and [my blog article](https://medium.com/@xianghangmi/resident-evil-understanding-residential-ip-proxy-as-a-dark-service-dea9010a0e29?sk=1b84f109431dfd92a0c73ec101b21289) for more information. Here, we will not go through those details, but  focus on datasets and sourcecode, which may facilitage future research.
